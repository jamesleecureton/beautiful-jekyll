This is my first post on my newly minted site.  I have found an online and accredited university, [UoPeople](uopeople.edu).  Cost are extremely accessible and registration is open to all.  I have joined, seeking a Bachelor's Degree in Compuer Science, and will do my best to document my experience.  I might include other bits along the way.  If you find me, I hope I offer some value.
